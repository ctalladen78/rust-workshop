# Rust Workshop for Beginners

This is a workshop (RailsBridge-style) for programmers who want to learn Rust. Students are expected to already be familiar with programming topics like [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow), [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), and [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type). Prior knowledge of a [compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) is not a requirement.
