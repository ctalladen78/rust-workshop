# Introduction to RUST

## Goal of the workshop

To learn how Rust works and use hands-on exercises to gain experience with Rust programming.

## History

Started as a personal project and was adopted by Mozilla in 2009. It is designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language. It was officially released in May 2015 and it has a very vibrant community. [0],[1]

- general purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language
- designed to be fast and safe: thread safety, memory safety, no segfaults
- supports pure-functional, concurrent-actor, imperative-procedural and object-oriented styles

## What sorts of things are written in Rust?

- the [Rust compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src) itself
